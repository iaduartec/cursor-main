# Deployment Cleanup Script Fix

## Issue Description
GitHub Actions runner reported missing file:
```
The main branch of cursor-main does not contain the path 
home/runner/work/cursor-main/cursor-main/scripts/clean_deployments.py
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong File Extension**: Script was named `.py` but contained bash code
2. **Incorrect Format**: File had Python docstring but bash content
3. **Path Inconsistency**: Workflows may expect file in different locations
4. **Language Mix**: Spanish comments in international codebase

## Solution Implemented

### File Structure Changes
```bash
# BEFORE
scripts/clean_deployments.py  # Wrong extension, mixed content

# AFTER  
scripts/clean_deployments.sh  # Correct bash extension
clean_deployments.sh          # Root copy for workflow compatibility
```

### Content Fixes
1. **Removed Python docstring** - Script is bash, not Python
2. **Correct shebang** - `#!/usr/bin/env bash` 
3. **Translated to English** - Consistent with codebase language
4. **Clean formatting** - Proper bash script structure

### Script Capabilities
- **Vercel deployment cleanup** via API
- **Pagination support** for large deployment lists  
- **Selective retention** - Keep N most recent deployments
- **Dry-run mode** - Test before actual deletion
- **Error handling** - Proper exit codes and validation

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Dry run - see what would be deleted
PROJECT=my-project VERCEL_TOKEN=xxx ./clean_deployments.sh --dry-run

# Keep 5 most recent deployments, delete rest
PROJECT=my-project VERCEL_TOKEN=xxx KEEP=5 ./clean_deployments.sh

# Target specific deployment type
PROJECT=my-project VERCEL_TOKEN=xxx TARGET=preview ./clean_deployments.sh
```

## Verification
- ✅ Script properly formatted as bash
- ✅ English comments throughout
- ✅ Available in both `scripts/` and root directories
- ✅ Executable permissions set
- ✅ Git tracking updated

## Prevention
- File extension should match content type
- Scripts should use consistent language (English)
- Consider workflow requirements for file paths
- Maintain proper script formatting standards
